"""Affiliation-line recognition: the structural cue that a comma-separated
address line is an institutional affiliation (so a byline whose superscript marker
the OCR dropped is still routed out of the body), plus the country lexicon and
postal/place-tail regexes it leans on.

Pure string predicates over already-OCR'd text; depends only on ``text`` for the
sentence-end test.  ``_is_affiliation_line`` is the one name consumed elsewhere
(``classify``); the rest support it."""
