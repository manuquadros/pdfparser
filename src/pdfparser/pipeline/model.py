"""LightOnOCR seam: OCR one page image to markdown via a vLLM server.

The GPU work runs in a vLLM OpenAI-compatible server (see ``deploy/vllm/``), so
this module is a thin HTTP client rather than an in-process model load.  It keeps
the seam contract the rest of the pipeline depends on — ``load_ocr_model()``
returns an ``OcrModel`` bundle and ``_ocr_page(image, ocr) -> str`` — so nothing
downstream changes, and the package no longer depends on torch or transformers.
