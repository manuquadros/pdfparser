"""Figure re-OCR: recover a figure LightOnOCR drops *entirely* from a page.

The full-page pass occasionally emits neither the ``![image]`` bbox placeholder
nor the "Figure N" caption for a figure — the figure vanishes from the document,
and re-OCRing the whole page reproduces the omission (it is systematic, not a
sporadic miss).  Re-OCRing a tight crop of just the figure recovers it, exactly as
:mod:`pdfparser.pipeline.tables` recovers content dropped from dense tables.

Unlike a dropped table — text the PDF text layer can localize directly — a figure
is an *image*, invisible to the text layer; only its caption is text.  So we
(1) enumerate the figure numbers the text layer carries as caption labels,
(2) subtract the numbers the OCR actually emitted (a gap, e.g. 1,2,3,_,5,6,7),
and (3) for each missing number localize its caption via the text layer, crop the
band spanning the figure (the text-free area above the caption) plus the caption,
and re-OCR that tight crop.  The recovered ``![image]`` placeholder's box is
crop-relative, so it is mapped back to page coordinates and spliced into the page
markdown as an ordinary placeholder — the assembler then crops and renders it
through the unchanged figure path.

Detection only *nominates* candidates; the re-OCR confirms one by actually
returning a figure box.  A spurious candidate (a caption-shaped line that is not a
figure, or a caption-below-figure layout this above-the-caption crop can't reach)
re-OCRs to no placeholder and is silently dropped — so the step never injects a
bogus figure.

Leaf module: touches the PDF (text layer + render) and the GPU (via the injected
``ocr_region`` callback), keeping the pure ``_assemble_html`` core model-free.
