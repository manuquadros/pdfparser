"""Table-cell bold recovery from the PDF text layer.

LightOnOCR transcribes table cells as plain ``<td>``/``<th>`` with no emphasis
markup, even when the source is boldfaced (section/category rows, total rows).  The
bold is a genuine font property in the PDF text layer (per-glyph font weight); this
pass localizes each transcribed ``<table>`` against the layer, reads the weight of
the glyphs each cell matched, and re-wraps a predominantly-bold ``<td>`` in
``<strong>``.

Pure CPU + text-layer work — no OCR, no network.  Best-effort enrichment: a cell the
OCR altered (so its text matches no glyph run), a rotated table, or an image-only
page with no text layer all leave the markup unchanged.  Runs after the table re-OCR
/ text-layer-rebuild passes so the bold lands on the table HTML that actually
survives.  Header ``<th>`` cells are left alone (the render's CSS already
differentiates them); only data ``<td>`` cells are bolded.
