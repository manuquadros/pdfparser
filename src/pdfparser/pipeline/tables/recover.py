"""Table re-OCR: recover content LightOnOCR drops from dense full-page tables.

The full-page OCR pass silently drops small in-table content — e.g. a column-
spanning subheader like ``Relative activity (%)`` — at *every* render resolution,
yet re-OCRing the table on its own as a tight crop recovers it (and produces the
``colspan``/``rowspan`` structure the full-page pass omits).  So for each table
region we locate it on the page (``localize``), re-OCR just that crop, and
substitute the result.

Crops are planned for the whole document first (text-layer localization plus a
coverage gate that skips regions the page already captured in full), then re-OCR'd
in one batched ``ocr_regions`` call so the server processes them concurrently.

Leaf pass: touches the PDF (render + text layer, via ``layers``/``localize``) and
the GPU (via the injected ``ocr_regions`` callback), so the pure ``_assemble_html``
core stays model-free."""
