"""Public exception hierarchy raised at the pipeline's boundary.

A leaf module (it imports nothing else from the package) so the seam modules
(:mod:`model`, :mod:`render`) and the entry point can raise typed errors that a
caller — e.g. a batch-ingest worker — classifies for *retry* vs. *permanent failure*
without reaching into ``httpx``/``pypdfium2`` internals.  The original library
exception is always preserved as ``__cause__`` (``raise … from``).  See
``plans/annotation-hub-integration.md`` (Tasks A).
