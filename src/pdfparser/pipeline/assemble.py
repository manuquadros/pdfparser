"""Document assembly: per-page block parts → cleaned, classified HTML shell.

Design B-prime (see plans/replace-falcon-with-lightonocr.md):
render → per-page markdown → block HTML → cleanup/merge → document shell.

``_assemble_html`` is the pure (no-GPU) core — render-free, model-free — so it is
unit-testable by feeding synthetic markdown + images.  ``lightonocr_pdf_to_html``
wires in rendering and OCR around it.
