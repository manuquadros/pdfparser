"""PDF text-layer extraction and the geometry/text-folding primitives it shares
with table localization.

This is the foundational leaf the four post-OCR text-layer passes build on —
table recovery/repair (``tables``), figure recovery (``recover_figures``) and
reconciliation (``reconcile``).  It deliberately imports nothing from the rest of
the pipeline so it can sit *under* ``tables`` (which used to host this code and so
became a false hub for the three passes that only wanted the cache): the dependency
now runs one way, ``tables``/``reconcile``/``recover_figures``/``assemble`` →
``layers``.

The cache (:class:`_DocumentLayers`) holds one open ``PdfDocument`` and a lazy
per-page :class:`_PageLayer`, so a page several passes localize against is walked
char by char only once."""
