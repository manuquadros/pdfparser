    A heading form normally counts as furniture only when the same line also
    appears as a plain paragraph somewhere: a running header/footer is body text
    the OCR promotes to a heading on sparse pages, so it shows up in both forms.  A
    line that recurs *only* as a heading is usually a genuine section heading the
    article legitimately repeats (e.g. "Purification of X" under both Methods and
