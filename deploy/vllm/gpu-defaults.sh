# GPU-capability-derived vLLM flags, shared by the two deployment shapes
# (run-server.sh on the host, entrypoint.sh inside the unified image) so the same
# invocation serves an Ada card and a T4.
#
# Two of the server's settings depend on the card, and they fail very differently:
#
#   --dtype bfloat16        vLLM refuses it below sm_80 and says so at startup
#                           ("Bfloat16 is only supported on GPUs with compute
#                           capability of at least 8.0"), so that half is a
#                           legible stop.
#   --attention-backend     vLLM's auto-selection picks FlashInfer on a T4 --
#                           FlashInferBackend.supports_compute_capability(7.5)
#                           answers True -- and the image's prebuilt kernels then
#                           kill the engine on the first request with
#                           "BatchPrefillWithPagedKVCache failed with error
#                           invalid argument".  Because that gate is optimistic
#                           rather than wrong-by-omission, auto-selection never
#                           corrects itself: the backend has to be named.
#
# The backend is a *command-line flag*.  VLLM_ATTENTION_BACKEND, which most
# advice online still names, does not exist in vLLM 0.22.1 -- the string appears
# nowhere in the package -- so setting it is silently inert.
#
# Whatever the caller already exported wins; this only fills blanks.

# Lowest compute capability among the visible GPUs -- the server has to run on
# every one of them -- as "<major>.<minor>", or empty when nvidia-smi is absent
