# vLLM server for LightOnOCR (podman)

Runs `lightonai/LightOnOCR-2-1B-bbox` under vLLM as an OpenAI-compatible
server, in a rootless podman container. All GPU/torch work lives in vLLM;
`pdfparser` itself carries no torch or transformers — its model seam
(`pipeline/model.py`) is a thin HTTP client that talks to this server.

The server stays up and keeps the model resident, so each document pays the
HTTP round-trip, not a ~35 s model reload.

Two deployment shapes, both covered below:

- **Single container** (`Containerfile`) — vLLM **and** pdfparser in one image;
  convert PDFs with `podman exec`. Simplest when both run on the same box.
- **Server only** (`run-server.sh`) — just the vLLM server; run pdfparser from
  any environment (it only needs `pip install pdfparser`, no GPU) pointed at the
  server via `PDFPARSER_VLLM_URL`.

## One-time host setup

1. **Install podman** (needs sudo; the only step that does):

   ```
   sudo apt-get install -y podman
   ```

2. **GPU passthrough is already configured.** NVIDIA CDI is generated at
   `/var/run/cdi/nvidia.yaml` (`kind: nvidia.com/gpu`). Verify podman sees it:

   ```
   podman run --rm --device nvidia.com/gpu=all \
     docker.io/nvidia/cuda:12.4.1-base-ubuntu22.04 nvidia-smi
   ```

   If the device is ever missing (the `/var/run/cdi` copy is on tmpfs and is
   lost on reboot), regenerate it to the **same** path:
   `sudo nvidia-ctk cdi generate --output=/var/run/cdi/nvidia.yaml`. For a
   reboot-persistent spec, write to `/etc/cdi/nvidia.yaml` instead **and delete
   the `/var/run/cdi` copy** — the same qualified device name in two spec dirs
   makes podman reject the CDI registry as a duplicate.

## GPU compute capability (dtype and attention backend)

Two of the server's settings depend on the card. Both `run-server.sh` and the
unified image derive them at start time from the GPU's compute capability
(`gpu-defaults.sh`), so neither has to be edited per machine:

| Card | Example | `--dtype` | `--attention-backend` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ampere or newer (sm_80+) | RTX Ada, A10, A100 | `bfloat16` | omitted — vLLM chooses (FlashInfer) |
| Turing (sm_75) | Tesla T4 | `float32` | `TRITON_ATTN` |
| Undetectable (no `nvidia-smi`) | — | `float32` | `TRITON_ATTN`, with a warning |

An explicit value always wins, so either can be forced:

```
DTYPE=float16 ATTENTION_BACKEND=FLEX_ATTENTION ./run-server.sh
```

**The backend is a command-line flag, not an environment variable.**
`VLLM_ATTENTION_BACKEND` — which most advice online, and this repo's own earlier
comments, still name — **does not exist in vLLM 0.22.1**: the string appears
nowhere in the package, so exporting it is silently inert and the server goes on
selecting FlashInfer. The live knob is `--attention-backend <NAME>` (or
`--attention-config '{"backend": "<NAME>"}'`; the two are mutually exclusive and
vLLM raises if both are given). `ATTENTION_BACKEND` above is *this script's* env
knob, which becomes that flag.

**Why both are needed on a T4, and why only one of them is obvious.** The dtype
half fails loudly at startup — vLLM refuses `bfloat16` below sm_80 and says so
(*"Bfloat16 is only supported on GPUs with compute capability of at least
8.0"*). The backend half fails on the **first request**, killing the engine and
taking the whole server down with it:

```
RuntimeError: BatchPrefillWithPagedKVCache failed with error invalid argument
EngineCore encountered a fatal error … EngineDeadError
```

That one will not resolve itself by leaving the choice to vLLM.
`FlashInferBackend`'s own gate answers `supports_compute_capability(7.5) → True`,
so auto-selection picks FlashInfer on a T4 and the image's prebuilt kernels then
fail at launch — an optimistic gate, not a missing one. The backend has to be
named. `TRITON_ATTN` is the one that reports support down to sm_60 and takes
fp16; **`FLASH_ATTN` does not support sm_75** and is not an alternative there.

### float16 is not an option for this model

The obvious dtype below sm_80 is fp16, and it is **silently wrong here**. The
weights are bfloat16; cast to float16 the server starts, reports healthy, serves
200s at full throughput — and every page comes back as `!!!!!!!!` (token 0, the
signature of non-finite logits). Measured on one page of
`tests/fixtures/31051047.pdf`, same image and request for all three:

| `--dtype` | backend | output |
|---|---|---|
| `bfloat16` | FlashInfer | correct markdown |
| `float16` | FlashInfer | `!!!!` |
| `float16` | `TRITON_ATTN` | `!!!!` |

So it is the **dtype**, not the backend — and a pre-Ampere card has no bfloat16
to fall back on. That leaves `float32`, the only remaining width that cannot
overflow. It costs ~4.8 GiB of weights (fine on a T4's 16 GiB, an OOM on a 6 GiB
card) and it is slow. That is a bad trade taken deliberately: a server that OOMs
at startup fails immediately and legibly, whereas one that OCRs every page to
`!` fails at the far end of the pipeline, as empty documents.

**The pre-Ampere path is not covered by the determinism spike, and fp32 output
quality has not been verified on a T4** — it could not be measured on the 6 GiB
development card, which OOMs before serving. Run `./smoke-test.sh` and confirm
the output is markdown before trusting a document to it. If fp32 proves too slow,
`deploy/p100/`'s transformers shim is the fallback — but note it runs fp16 too,
so smoke-test its output as well rather than assuming it escapes this.

Expect Turing to be materially slower than an Ampere+ card: Triton attention
replaces FlashInfer, fp32 replaces bf16, and the run sits outside the pinned-vLLM
determinism gate the spike validated. A **P100 (sm_60) is out of scope for this
image entirely** — it has no Pascal kernels at all; see `deploy/p100/`.

If a vLLM upgrade ever renames a backend, the valid names are its own enum:

```
podman run --rm --device nvidia.com/gpu=all --entrypoint python3 \
  docker.io/vllm/vllm-openai:v0.22.1 -c \
  'from vllm.v1.attention.backends.registry import AttentionBackendEnum as E; print(sorted(m.name for m in E))'
```

Check the flag itself the same way — `vllm serve --help | grep attention` — since
it is the half of this that a version bump is most likely to move.

## Single container (pdfparser + vLLM)

Build the unified image from the repo root (the build context needs `src/` and
`pyproject.toml`):

```
podman build -f deploy/vllm/Containerfile -t lighton-pdfparser .
```

Start it as a warm server (mount the HF cache to skip the model download; the
`HF_HOME` env points vLLM at the mount regardless of the image's home dir):

```
podman run -d --name lighton \
  --device nvidia.com/gpu=all --ipc=host \
  -v "$HOME/.cache/huggingface:/hf-cache:rw" -e HF_HOME=/hf-cache \
  lighton-pdfparser
```

Then convert PDFs against the in-container server with `podman exec` (the image
sets `PDFPARSER_VLLM_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1`, so no flags needed):

```
podman exec lighton python3 -m pdfparser /data/in.pdf /data/out.html
```

Mount your input/output dir with `-v` on `podman run` to make `/data` visible.
The server stays resident between `exec`s — that's the whole point of one
long-lived container over a one-shot-per-PDF run.

## Server only

```
./run-server.sh
```

First run pulls the ~16 G `vllm/vllm-openai:v0.22.1` image (disk is tight — see
below). Confirm that exact tag is published first — the image tag set can lag
the pip release the spike used; check with
`podman search --list-tags docker.io/vllm/vllm-openai` (or the Docker Hub tags
page) and override via `IMAGE=…/vllm-openai:<tag> ./run-server.sh` if needed.
The model weights are **not** re-downloaded: `run-server.sh` mounts your
existing `~/.cache/huggingface` (already holds the 2.7 G bbox model). The server
is ready when the log prints `Application startup complete` on port 8000.

Tunables are env overrides, e.g.:

```
PORT=8001 GPU_MEM_UTIL=0.80 ./run-server.sh
```

### Which interface the port lands on

**The default is `127.0.0.1`** — the server is unreachable from other machines
until you say otherwise. vLLM has no authentication of its own, so the port is
the whole access control; publishing on every interface (podman's behaviour when
`-p` names no address) would serve the model to anyone who reaches the host.
`BIND_ADDR` names the one address to publish on:

```
BIND_ADDR="$(tailscale ip -4)" ./run-server.sh   # tailnet only
./run-server.sh                                  # loopback: podman exec, SSH tunnel
BIND_ADDR=0.0.0.0 ./run-server.sh                # every interface, deliberately
```

An IPv6 literal is bracketed automatically, and a value that is already
bracketed is taken as-is. `0.0.0.0` and `::` are accepted as the explicit way to
ask for every interface — that is a decision you now have to make out loud
rather than get by omission.

The address must be up before the server starts. A boot-time unit can easily
beat `tailscaled` to it, and podman's own bind failure names neither the address
nor the cause, so the script checks first and says which address is missing (the
two wildcards are exempt, belonging to no interface).

Note this is the *only* control over the public interface. A Tailscale ACL
governs what may cross the tailnet; it has nothing to say about a port that is
also listening on a public IP. The two are not substitutes — you want both, and
`BIND_ADDR` is the half that lives here.

The other half, and the network design around it — tailnet ACL and tags, host
firewall, optional app-layer token, and how to verify the result actually
holds — is in [`../SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md). It covers this server and the
P100 shim alike; read it before exposing either on a VM with a public IP.

## Smoke test

With the server up, in another shell:

```
./smoke-test.sh
```

Renders fixture page 1 with the project's own renderer and OCRs it through the
chat endpoint; prints the first ~1200 chars of markdown. `PDF=… ./smoke-test.sh`
to pick another file.

### Against a server on another host

The GPU box and the machine holding the PDFs need not be the same: the script
renders locally and sends only the page image, so point it at the remote server.
`BASE_URL` (or `PDFPARSER_VLLM_URL`, the same variable the pipeline reads)
overrides the endpoint, and `MODEL`/`PDFPARSER_VLLM_MODEL` the served name:

```
BASE_URL=http://<vm-host>:8000/v1 ./smoke-test.sh
```

For this to reach anything, the server must have been started with a
`BIND_ADDR` that is reachable from here — it binds loopback otherwise, so a
remote client gets a refused connection no matter what the firewall allows. On
a tailnet that is `BIND_ADDR="$(tailscale ip -4)" ./run-server.sh`.

Alternatively leave the server on loopback and forward the port over SSH, which
keeps the default endpoint working unchanged:

```
ssh -N -L 8000:127.0.0.1:8000 <vm-host> &     # in one shell
./smoke-test.sh                               # in another
```

An unreachable host, a closed port or a dead tunnel is reported by the `/models`
probe before the render, so it fails in a second rather than after rendering.

Once the smoke test passes, the same variable drives a full conversion:

```
PDFPARSER_VLLM_URL=http://<vm-host>:8000/v1 pdm run python -m pdfparser in.pdf out.html
```

A remote server makes the round-trip latency per page visible; raise
`PDFPARSER_OCR_CONCURRENCY` (default 4) if the link is slow but the GPU is idle.

## Calling it from the pipeline

OpenAI-compatible chat completions, one image per request, greedy:

```python
import base64, io
from openai import OpenAI

# 127.0.0.1, not localhost — rootless podman forwards the port on IPv4 only.
client = OpenAI(base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1", api_key="EMPTY")

def ocr_image(img) -> str:  # img: PIL.Image
    buf = io.BytesIO(); img.save(buf, format="PNG")
    b64 = base64.b64encode(buf.getvalue()).decode()
    resp = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="lightonocr",
        temperature=0.0,
        max_tokens=2048,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": [
            {"type": "image_url",
             "image_url": {"url": f"data:image/png;base64,{b64}"}},
        ]}],
    )
    return resp.choices[0].message.content
```

This is the drop-in for `_ocr_page`'s model call. Per the determinism spike,
keep **substring/structural** acceptance — greedy vLLM is byte-stable run-to-run
but jitters bbox low-order digits across batch composition.

## Stop

`run-server.sh` uses `--rm`, so:

```
podman stop lighton-vllm
```

removes the container. To keep it running across reboots, install it as a
podman **quadlet** (systemd user unit) — ask and I'll generate the
`~/.config/containers/systemd/lighton-vllm.container` file.

## Notes / caveats

- **Disk:** the host is at ~95 % (53 G free). The image is ~16 G; it fits, but
  prune old images (`podman image prune`) if a pull fails for space.
- **6 GiB card:** `--enforce-eager` (no CUDA-graph capture) and
  `--gpu-memory-utilization 0.85` are what fit on this GPU in the spike. On a
  bigger card, drop `--enforce-eager` for CUDA graphs (`ENFORCE_EAGER=""`) and
  raise utilization.
- **Image tag** is pinned to `v0.22.1` to match the validated spike. Bumping it
  re-opens the determinism/fidelity question — re-run the spike against the new
  tag before trusting it.
- **flashinfer, twice over:** two unrelated settings carry the name.
  `VLLM_USE_FLASHINFER_SAMPLER=0` (always set) avoids the startup nvcc JIT
  failure on this runtime-only host — the container has no CUDA toolkit either,
  so leave it set unless you switch to a `flashinfer-jit-cache` image. The
  flashinfer *attention backend* is a separate matter, handled by capability
  above; disabling the sampler does not disable it.
